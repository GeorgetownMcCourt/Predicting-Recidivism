# Predicting Recidivism in the U.S. Prison Population

## Overview/Synopsis
The goal of this project is to analyze correlations between recidivism and socio-economic characteristics, mental health, family background, drug use, type of prior offenses and convictions, etc. to predict the probability of recidivism among prisoners. We intend to make predictions regarding important risk factors and to draw policy conclusions as to how the risk of recidivism can be lowered for different types of (former) prisoners. For instance, identifying certain mental health patterns or drug abuse behaviors that significantly increase the risk of recidivism would help in setting priorities in health care and/or social work care for released prisoners.

## Data Used
The data used in this project comes from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF) and the 2004 Survey of Inmates in Federal Correctional Facilities (SIFCF). These surveys, collectively referred to as the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISFCF), provide nationally representative data on inmates held in state prisons and federal prisons for the year 2004. Collected through personal interviews conducted from October 2003 through May 2004, the data captures information about prisonersâ€™ current offense and sentence, criminal history, family background, socio-economic characteristics, prior drug and alcohol use and treatment programs, gun possession and use, as well as prison activities, programs, and services. 


This data is maintained by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data and has been pre-processed to anonymize any potentially identifiable information.
